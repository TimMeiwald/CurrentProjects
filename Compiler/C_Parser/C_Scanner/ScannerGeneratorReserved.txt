SCANNER GENERATOR DOCUMENTATION

Everything before EOL is ignored to allow for documentation

RESERVED FOR SCANNER GENERATOR
NEWLINE
WHITESPACE
EOL
OPEN
CLOSE
INDENT
STRINGS
COMMENTS
MULTILINECOMMENTS
KEYWORDS
OPERATORS
TERMINATION
Comments and Strings must be defined in order to avoid tokenizing the substrings
of strings or comments that match operators or keywords as operators or keywords

EOL- Despite name is the statement seperator, in C that's NEWLINE
In other language it could be : or ; or something else. 

WHITESPACE also reserved because it's a pain otherwise
WHITESPACE = -1 in Dict
NEWLINE = -2
OPEN - Opening characters for something
CLOSE - Closing characters for something

INDENT - Indentation value e.g in C OPEN{ CLOSE}, Python OPEN "\n    " CLOSE EOL
STRINGS - Followed by OPEN and CLOSE describing string open and close chars
COMMENTS - Followed by OPEN and CLOSE describing string open and close chars
MULTILINECOMMENTS -Followed by OPEN and CLOSE describing string open and close chars
KEYWORDS - All Keywords used by language
OPERATORS - All operators used by language, for something like sizeof()
define sizeof( as an operator and ) as an operator. punctuation e.g ; is 
also an operator since it provides context to the parser it is an operator
in the language sense albeit not in the programmatical sense
TERMINATION - Used merely to make scanner generator easier to code
NOTE: Some operators such as & for pointers and & for bitwise in C are context sensitive
This scanner ONLY does context free grammer so & in C only needs to be added to
OPERATOR list once.
